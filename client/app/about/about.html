  <h3>Hello!</h3>
  <p>
    I'm <strong>Fred</strong>! Curator of <a>freddit</a>. You can tell me
    anything you want and I'll keep track of it for you.
  </p>
  <h4>What is freddit?</h4>
  <p>
    freddit is <em>(you guessed it)</em> a <a href="reddit">reddit</a>
    clone. The developers had this use case in mind:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    So we just initiated scrum (which is <em>awesome</em>) but the size of our
    dev team is a bit of a <a href="">scrum-but</a>. Two potential negative
    side-effects of having an oversized dev team can be
    <strong>impersonable</strong> and <strong>unfocused</strong>
    retrospectives. We hope that freddit can facilitate focused retro's <em>a l√°</em>
    <a href="http://scrumandkanban.co.uk/lean-coffee/">Lean Coffee</a>. (<strong>Fred</strong>
    being the digital facilitator.)
  </blockquote>
  <h4>How it works</h4>
  <p>
    Organization members voice their comments/question/concerns to
    <strong>Fred</strong>, who saves them into freddit. (We'll refer to theses as
    <strong>posts</strong> from now on.) Posts can be anything from "Pair
    programming with somebody who eats garlic "
